What is the objective? What is the problem statement? When confronted with a lot of text that I need to read, I sometimes lose concentration and never finish reading it. I find that I can finish audiobooks when I can't finish reading written texts. Even if I don't retain much from what I've listened to, I will often remember a dim outline of what was covered, and my reaction to it. The aim is to assist myself in finishing texts that I might otherwise abandon. The proposed method is to use a text-to-speech synthesiser to read the text to me. </p>
<p>
Text to speech garbles certain words and is sometimes hard to understand. To assist with comprehension I would like the source text to be displayed on screen. The current word being spoken should be highlighted, and there should be a way to move around the text to change what is being narrated.

I have made two attempts so far at solving the problem:

	<li><a href="web-speech-synthesis/">Web Speech Synthesis</a></li>
	<li><a href="amazon-polly/">Amazon Polly</a></li>
</ul>
